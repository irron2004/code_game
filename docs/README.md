# Algorithm Learning Game Documentation Hub

This folder hosts the living documentation set for the Algorithm Learning Game, a browser-based pathfinding playground designed for elementary learners. Each document is scoped to a specific audience:

| Doc | Audience | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PRD.md` | Product / Curriculum | Vision, target users, and success metrics |
| `SRS.md` | Engineering | Functional and non-functional requirements |
| `SCOPE_PLAN.md` | Delivery | Milestones, staffing, and release gates |
| `QA_TEST_PLAN.md` | QA / Facilitators | Manual + automated test coverage |
| `UX_GUIDE.md` | Design | Interaction and accessibility guardrails |
| `LEVEL_AUTHORING.md` | Content Authors | Level format and validation rules |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributors | Workflow, style, and review process |
| `SECURITY_PRIVACY.md` | Compliance | Data handling expectations |
| `ANALYTICS_METRICS.md` | Data / PM | Measurement strategy and dashboards |

## How to Use This Folder

1. **Start with the PRD and SRS** to understand scope and constraints before opening issues or writing code.
2. **Update documents alongside changes.** Every PR that alters functionality should touch relevant docs.
3. **Link sections in issues/PRs.** Use headings (e.g., `SRS.md#path-simulation`) when referencing requirements.
4. **Versioning.** Significant updates should include a changelog entry at the bottom of the modified file.
